# Advent of Code 2019

[Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019)

## Setup

I previously installed `asdf`.

I setup local versions of Elixir and Erlang:

```
$ asdf local elixir 1.9.2
$ asdf local erlang 22.1.3
```

## Puzzles and input

Code for each puzzle can be found in separate module files. The day 1, puzzle 1 module is named `AdventOfCode2019.Day1Puzzle1` and is in the file `lib/advent_of_code_2019/day_1_puzzle_1.ex`.

Puzzle input files are stored in the `input` sub-directory and are named like `day-1-puzzle-1`.

For each puzzle, there is a `process_input` function in the respective module that will read the input file and output the puzzle answer.
